Bouncy Balls!

This is a relatively complex example of how to use
Java to make a stimulating graphics program. In order
to compile it, you will need `core.jar`, which you
may find in the `../resources` directory.

To compile, just copy that `core.jar` file here, and
then type:

    javac -classpath core.jar:. *.java

To run the program:

    java -classpath core.jar:. Main

The graphics are handled by Processing's graphics
libraries. This is a full-fledged Java program, though.
It only _uses_ Processing's library.
